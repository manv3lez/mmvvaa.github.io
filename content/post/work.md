First things first. I have had an account in many of today's services.

This is the first post about work. Finding work. Working. Making things that work. Making things that don't work, work.

I recently read [The 21st Century Case For Gold: A New Information Theory Of Money] (https://americanprinciplesproject.org/economics/new-george-gilder-book-the-21st-century-case-for-gold-a-new-information-theory-of-money/) by George Gilder and [The DAO of Capital: Austrian Investing in a Distorted World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16599562-the-dao-of-capital) by Mark Spitznagel, and I am currently reading [Cents and Sensibility](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32889468-cents-and-sensibility).

I am also slowly but surely reading Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce and The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

Before you continue, please take a moment to configure your archetypes.

Archetypes are located in the `archetypes` directory in the source of your site. To learn more about archetypes, visit [Archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content/archetypes/) on the Hugo website. And when you're ready, check out the [Customizing](https://comfusion.github.io/after-dark/#customizing) section of the After Dark documentation for additional options.
